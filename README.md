Hi, my name is Katya Pavlenko, I am a frontend developer currently based in Tel-Aviv, Israel, originally from Saint-Ptersburg, Russia.

Buzzwords about my interests: javascript, angular, testing, CI/CD

I have a [blog on medium](https://medium.com/@cakeinpanic)(in russian) where I am explaining different programming stuff in super simple words to let more russian-speaking developers dive in new technologies easier. 

Quote in my profile is form Daft Punk "Technologic" song which I love best in Pentatonix acapella cover, [check it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MteSlpxCpo)!
